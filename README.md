Hello there 👋
I am Alekhyaa Nelluri and I’m on a journey to unveil insights and drive impact

●	The project is an analysis of Mobile Gadget Gurus, a distributor that sells mobile technology devices to retailers across the country. Customers place orders and have the items shipped to their stores or distribution centers.

●	The COO and middle management of Mobile Gadget Gurus needs a quick and easy way to track the operations of the business on a daily basis. So I designed a dashboard for operational managers to use daily to manage their business.

●	The dashboard consists of four different navigable pages: Home page; a page for customer information; product information; and the sales rep information page. The data is from 2015 operations.
